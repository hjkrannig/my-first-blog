djangogirls-tutorial started at 2019/02/19 
I'm following the tutorial as an recommendation from Nigel George, 
author of 'Build your first website with Django 2.1.'
This book is well written and the steps are good to follow. Until
now I think, the djangogirls-tutorial is a high value recommendation.
...when I finished the dg-tutorial I will give you an assesment and 
I hope, you get a working source-code in the git-repository.
...so long hjk
